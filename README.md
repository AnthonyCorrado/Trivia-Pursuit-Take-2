## Spending Your Days Searching for a Place to Drink and Think? 

Your search ends here...eventually. Still a work in progress. This is a web app designed to locate all local bar trivia nights. You will be able to search via geolocation or through a multipurpose search field

This is version 2 of the hypothetical smash hit app, "Trivia Pursuit." This new version is being developed for mobile first using Foundation. The interface is getting streamlined as well.

## How it works

Let Google use your GPS location, use the search field or have the NSA notify the app where you are currently. Then, using Yelp's API, the app finds bars containing "trivia" in their reviews. As of now, the day and time fields have to be hardcoded. However, super amazing nokogiri use in the future should correct this

## What Makes it Tick
* Ruby on Rails and some Javascript
* Yelp API and Google Maps API
* Foundation for the styling and mobile responsiveness
* Viewers like you


## Future Additions

* will use screen scraping techniques to auto fill the trivia day field
* will use a sleek touch/swipe interface
* allow you to send text or email invites to friends
